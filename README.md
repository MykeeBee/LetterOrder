# LetterOrder

This was a personal coding challenge to produce a list of words where the letters were in alphabetical order such as abbey, glory, etc.

Thanks to [Nick](https://github.com/codejunkie83) and [Josh](https://github.com/OMGtechy) for their help with this one.

The word list was kindly taken from this [repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).
